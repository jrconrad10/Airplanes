# Airplanes

This project uses java swing to create a GUI for airplanes to fly on a screen. Three radio buttons are created, one for doing nothing, one for random movement, and one for following the leader. There is one green leader airplane and three red follower airplanes. Pressing a radio button sets a movement pattern that can then be invoked on a plane by clicking it.
